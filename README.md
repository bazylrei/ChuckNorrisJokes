# ChuckNorrisJokes

Simple App who's sole purpose is displaying non-explicit Chuck Norris jokes.

Few notes:
As I had very limited time to complete the task due to going on holidays I'm afraid I did not have enough time to put the approriate amount of effort and precision into the project. 
I have however managed to build an app using MVVM, dependency injection, together with error handling and tests around the key functionality.

If I had more time I would definitely put more effort into the apps UI and would use SwiftUI instead of UIKit. 
However because I am a lot more fluent with UIKit and my time was limited I decided to go with the technology I know best.
I will happily rewrite the code using SwiftUI and Combine once I'm back, if that's something you'd be interested in.

Cheers
